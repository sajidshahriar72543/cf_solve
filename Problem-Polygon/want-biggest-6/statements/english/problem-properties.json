It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.``}\r\n\r\nMal and Cobb has made $n$ buildings of \\textbf{distinct} heights numbered from $1$ to $n$. They also make two lists of highest and lowest buildings (based on height) from first to each building. In the other words, they want to find $n$ highest and $n$ lowest heights from $1$ to $i$-th building ($1 \\le i \\le n$).\r\n\r\nFor example, Mal and Cobb has made four buildings and their heights are ${11, 5, 25, 6}$ meters. So the list of highest buildings is, $H$ = ${11, 11, 25, 25}$ and the list of lowest buildings is, $L$ =  ${11, 5, 5, 5}$.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Mal wants to check is she in dream or in reality. But accidentally she had lost her totem (a spinning top which determine whether she is in reality or dream). Now she wants help from you (may be she thought you as Nolan. Not bad, na?). \r\n\r\nYou have that two lists, $H$ and $L$. If it is possible to obtain original heights from two lists, Mal is in Reality. Otherwise she has made buildings in dream (maybe people can't do correct calculation in dream). If she is in reality give her the list of original heights. Otherwise report her she is in dream.","authorLogin":"rifatrraazz","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"Print one of the following answers per test case.\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n\\item If Mal in reality\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n\\item print number of buildings, $n$ at first line\r\n\\item in second line, print $n$ integers - height of each building\r\n\\end{itemize}\r\n\\item If Mal in dream, print $-1$ in a single line\r\n\\end{itemize}\r\n\r\nIf there multiple solutions, you can print any.","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"At first line of input is an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) denotes the number of test cases.
