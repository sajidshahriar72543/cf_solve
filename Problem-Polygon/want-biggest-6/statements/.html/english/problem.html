They also make two lists of highest and lowest buildings (based on height) from first to each building. In the other words, they want to find $$$n$$$ highest and $$$n$$$ lowest heights from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$-th building ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$).</P><P>For example, Mal and Cobb has made four buildings and their heights are $$${11, 5, 25, 6}$$$ meters. So the list of highest buildings is, $$$H$$$ = $$${11, 11, 25, 25}$$$ and the list of lowest buildings is, $$$L$$$ = $$${11, 5, 5, 5}$$$.</P><P>After that, Mal wants to check is she in dream or in reality. But accidentally she had lost her totem (a spinning top which determine whether she is in reality or dream). Now she wants help from you (may be she thought you as Nolan. Not bad, na?). </P><P>You have that two lists, $$$H$$$ and $$$L$$$. If it is possible to obtain original heights from two lists, Mal is in Reality. Otherwise she has made buildings in dream (maybe people can't do correct calculation in dream). If she is in reality give her the list of original heights.
