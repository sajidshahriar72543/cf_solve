For the 2nd tese case, we assume - 
\begin{itemize}
\item height of $1st$ building is 3, so, $H$ = ${3}$, $L$ = ${3}$.
\item height of $2nd$ building is 2, so, $H$ = ${3, 3}$, $L$ = ${3, 2}$
\item there are no possible height of $3rd$ building. Height of $3rd$ building is greater than $2$ (not equal $2$ because height of $2nd$ building is $2$) and less than $3$ (not equal $3$ because height of $1st$ building is $3$).
\end{itemize}
So, Mal and Cobb has made buildings in dream.
